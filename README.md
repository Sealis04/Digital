##Project Title
Arduino Based Bidirectional Visiter counter and Temperature that automatically turns on ElectricFan and Lights
The arduino directs whether there is someone inside the room or not, and if there is, turns on the lights and fans. If there is no one but the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the Fan would still turn on, but not the light.

## Features
-Made by using arduino 1.8.10
-Manages to turn on lights and fans when sensor detects someone has entered the room
-Manages to turn off lights and fans when the sensor detects that the last person has left the room
-Manages to detect the current temperature of the room, and turns on the fan when it has exceeded a set threshold

Arduino Based Bidirectional Visiter counter and Temperature that automatically turns on ElectricFan and Lights
The arduino directs whether there is someone inside the room or not, and if there is, turns on the lights and fans. If there is no one but the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, the Fan would still turn on, but not the light.
